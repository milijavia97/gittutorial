##Loops in python

While Loop: In python, while loop is used to execute a block of statements repeatedly until a given a condition is satisfied. And when the condition becomes false, the line immediately after the loop in program is executed.
2.For Loop: For loops are used for sequential traversal. For example: traversing a list or string or array etc. In Python, there is no C style for loop, i.e., for (i=0; i<n; i++). There is “for in” loop which is similar to for each loop in other languages.

3.Iterating by index of sequences: We can also use the index of elements in the sequence to iterate. The key idea is to first calculate the length of the list and in iterate over the sequence within the range of this length.

4.Using else statement with for loops: We can also combine else statement with for loop like in while loop. But as there is no condition in for loop based on which the execution will terminate so the else block will be executed immediately after for block finishes execution.

5.Nested Loops: Python programming language allows to use one loop inside another loop.

for iterator_var in sequence: for iterator_var in sequence: statements(s) statements(s)

6.Loop Control Statements: Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed. Python supports the following control statements.

Continue Statement: It returns the control to the beginning of the loop.

Break Statement: It brings control out of the loop

Pass Statement: We use pass statement to write empty loops. Pass is also used for empty control statement, function and classes.
